Computer Science Capstone Project
<br>by Sean Murphy '18, Pacific Lutheran University

Abstract:

The goal of this capstone project was to create an application that can be used by PLU music students to practice their singing skills.
Music students at PLU take four sections of Ear Training courses, and while an application for practicing their listening skills is
present, an application to practice the singing skills of the class is lacking. Therefore, this application is targeting music students,
specifically at PLU, with different exercises to practice singing skills. Using an API called “TarsosDSP”, I have created an application
that uses the microphone of a computer to listen to the students singing and will give them feedback on the particular exercise they
practiced. This program takes in the pitch, compares it to actual note values with a robust algorithm, then compares it to what the notes
should be in the specific exercise, and shows the students feedback based on what notes they sang. Exercises offered include chords,
scales, intervals, and more, and there are over 20 exercises per type.
